# Traffic Accident Analysis

This repository contains a detailed analysis of traffic accidents using various datasets, with a focus on understanding patterns related to **time of the day**, **day of the week**, **road surface conditions**, and **weather conditions**. The goal of this project is to identify trends and generate visual insights to help improve traffic safety measures.

## Project Overview

The project uses traffic accident data to generate various analyses and visualizations to explore how different factors, such as time, weather, and road surface conditions, impact accident frequency. This can help local authorities and researchers focus on high-risk periods and conditions.

### Features:
- Analysis of accidents based on **time of the day**, **day of the week**, **road surface conditions**, and **weather conditions**.
- Visualizations using bar plots, heatmaps, and other graphical representations to display patterns.

## Data Description

The dataset used in this project contains information about traffic accidents, including the following variables:
- `Time of the day`: The hour at which the accident occurred.
- `Day of the week`: The day of the week the accident happened.
- `Road surface conditions`: The condition of the road during the accident (e.g., dry, wet, snow).
- `Weather conditions`: The weather at the time of the accident (e.g., sunny, rainy, foggy).

## Installation

To run the analysis, you'll need to install the following Python libraries:

```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn
```

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/traffic-accident-analysis.git
cd traffic-accident-analysis
python traffic_accident_analysis.py
```
## Analysis and Visualizations

The analysis includes the following visualizations:

1. **Accidents by Time of the Day**: A bar plot showing how accidents are distributed throughout the day.

2. **Accidents by Day of the Week**: A bar plot showing the number of accidents on different days of the week.

3. **Accidents by Road Surface Conditions**: A bar plot showing accidents categorized by road surface conditions (e.g., dry, wet).

4. **Accidents by Weather Conditions**: A heatmap showing the relationship between accidents, weather conditions, and road surface conditions.
